# ðŸš€ Travel Tracker ðŸš€

#### A Front End Development Project by:
- [Edward Krupicka](https://github.com/edwardkrupicka)

#### Project Manager : Nik Seif

### Description
Travel Tracker is an application which allows the user to track trips (past, current and upcoming), schedule new trips / see their estimated costs, and track their total spent on trips annually. This application interacts with an API using Webpack and implements best SRP and OOP practices including a robust testing suite and full fetch functionality, both GET and POST. Accessibility has been considered using an audit by Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse.

- Ability to interact with friends' trips with likes, etc.
- Additional error handling to prevent adding trips on the same date
